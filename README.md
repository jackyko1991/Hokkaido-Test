# Hokkaido-Test
A simulation model for the admission exam in the Hokkaido University

The question is asking the student to pick an integer from 1-100. The student who picks a number without repeating other's value would have a bonus mark of 60, otherwise he will get no mark. The one with highest mark wins this game.

Which value should you choose to maximize your probability to win?

A online statistic sampling result is listed in result.txt.

A randomness ratio is added so that the user can control the degree of randomness other than just using the statistical result.
